                        Monteverde, Costa Rica is situated 4,662 feet above sea level. Monteverde’s famed cloud forests are the byproduct of fog (a thick, low-hanging cloud) tangling amongst the leaves and branches of the forest canopy. Trails and hanging bridges offer a close-up view of the diverse variety of animals and plants living in the forest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the main tourist locations in Monteverde is the town of Santa Elena, which is not only home to a variety of restaurants with delicious food, but a serpentarium as well. You can enjoy hiking, ziplining, and observing the native wildlife while staying in Monteverde. It’s a truly beautiful place.

            <h2> Colosseum, Rome </h2>
                <h3> Geographical Location: Italy, Europe </h3>
                    <p>
                        Rome is one of the oldest metropolitan areas in the world. With a history dating back to 700 BC with the birth of the Roman Empire, the city has maintained its status as a cultural and historical hub of Europe. The city is peppered with ancient monuments, statues, and piazzas from different eras of history. The most famous location, the Colosseum, is touted as one of the seven modern wonders of the world. Rome houses several world famous museums, such as the Borghese and the Vatican Museum. It is also the only city in the world to encompass a recognized country, Vatican City.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rome is also a great location for food, wine, and leisure. At the heart of Italy, Rome is a central gathering place for a diverse array of Italian cuisine; Neapolitan Pizza from the south, Tuscan wine, and truffle from the north. Rome’s most famous dish is carbonara. Beyond the food, Rome has a vibrant nightlife. The Trastevere neighborhood has plenty of bars and clubs for patrons and, just over the river, Centro’s shopping district is always bustling.
